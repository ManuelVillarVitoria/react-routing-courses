_The project consists of doing the following:_

_1.-Adding Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages (by entering a URL, without Links)._

_2.-Adding a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", one leading to "Courses"._

_3.-Making the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Course" component in the place of "Courses" (without passing any data for now)._

_4.-Passing the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there._

_5.-Passing the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param or score bonus points by passing it as query params (you need to manually parse them though!)._

_6.-Loading the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"._

_7.-Adding a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes._

_8.-Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)._
